Please import the whole project folder as a Maven Java project and then use Maven to build the project. 
After maven build is completed please execute the jar file weather-rest-service-0.0.1.jar in the target folder to open the rest service. 
After that you may use the browser to access http://localhost:8080/v1/weather?name=Melbourne to access the service.
Thank you.
